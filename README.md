# notesAndPracticeCode
Just a place to store my commented scripts and practice files, in case I ever need or want to access them from a new machine.  

I don't see any reason not to make my notes and practice code public.  

I'm learning what I'm learning.  

I know what I know.  

It is what it is.

Feel free to browse.
